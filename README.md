Craigslist Filter - Chrome Extension
=================
This chrome extension was designed to filter out results that the user has already seen or simply no longer wants to be seen. It adds a filter button to every post in a craigslist search, logs actions taken by the user and then prevents those results from being shown in the future. Filters are removable via the extension toolbar. 

Craigslist Filter is currently deprecated due to changes in the Chrome Extension framework and my lack of time! Please feel free to fork, update & improve.
